# **App Name**: AI Mind Weaver

## Core Features:

- Topic Input: Accept user input for the topic to generate a mind map for.
- AI Mind Map Generation: Use an LLM to generate the core branches, subtopics, and bullet points for the mind map, reasoning like a tool to decide when/if details are relevant.
- Dynamic Mind Map Rendering: Render the mind map dynamically using Mermaid.js or D3.js for interactive exploration.
- Expand/Collapse Branches: Allow users to expand and collapse branches of the mind map for focused viewing.
- Brief Explanations: Display tooltips or popovers with brief explanations for each node in the mind map generated using generative AI, reasoning like a tool to decide when/if details are relevant.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Muted purple (#9D7CBF) to represent intellect and creativity, leaning away from typical cliches, with brightness appropriate to a light color scheme.
- Background color: Light grey (#F2F0F4), a desaturated version of the primary to give a modern look.
- Accent color: Soft orange (#D98F57), an analogous hue to the primary, providing a warm contrast to attract the eye.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, creating a balance of techy and neutral appearance.
- Use simple, outline-style icons for each main branch category.
- Clean and minimal layout to ensure the mind map is the primary focus.
- Subtle animations when expanding and collapsing branches to provide visual feedback.
